# EmotiClean

A Chrome extension to replace bad words with emoji!

This extension will scan all words on a web page and look for some "naughty" words. If a "naughty" word is found, it will be replaced with an emoji which conveys a similar meaning.

It does not work well on sites that dynamically load their content such as Facebook or Google.

A good site to test the extension can be found [here] (http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2013/09/11/top_swear_words_most_popular_curse_words_on_facebook.html).

For devlopment, follow [this guide](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked) to install an extension locally.

This is a fork of a great open source extension [SimpleProfanityFilter](https://code.google.com/p/simpleprofanityfilter/).
